# Research Experience

Post-Doctoral Fellow, Lars Grabow, University of Houston Dept of Chem.
Eng. (2023-present)

-   Applied high-throughput screening with machine learning to identify
    viable oxides for static and dynamic catalysis in the context of
    oxygen evolution reaction.

-   Constructed automated high-throughput workflows for calculating the
    full reaction diagrams of single atom catalysts (doped graphene and
    MXenes) in the context of seawater electrolysis and chlorine
    evolution.

-   Provided computational modelling for various investigations as part
    of the Center for Programmable Energy Catalysts.

Post-Doctoral Fellow, Zachary W. Ulissi, Carnegie Mellon University Dept
of Chem. Eng. (2021-2023)

-   Exploration of reaction diagrams and microkinetic models for the
    dehydrogenation of isopropyl alcohol using intermetallic catalyst
    surfaces.

-   Developed software for the generalization of adsorbate placement on
    oxide surfaces for the application of oxygen evolution. Construction
    of machine learning models for the total DFT energies of adsorbed
    oxide surfaces.

-   Screened the chemical space of binary intermetallics for potential
    candidates catalysts for nitrate reduction reaction using machine
    learning and previously developed microkinetic models.

Ph.D., Shyue Ping Ong, University of California San Diego Dept of NEng.
(2016-2021)

-   Developed high-throughput workflows for the calculation of surface
    properties of elemental crystalline solids.

-   Explored dopant segregation at the grain boundaries and surfaces of
    refractory materials for the engineering of nanoscale structures.

-   Investigation of defect induced metal-to-insulator transition in
    several Mott insulators for the application of neuromorphic
    computing.
