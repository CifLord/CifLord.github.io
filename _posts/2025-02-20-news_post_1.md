The interactive Lykoi web app is now live! Check it out on the Lykoi tab above! Lykoi is a toy app but as a side hobby to provide an easy to use interface for designing catalysts and nanoparticles. The Wulff Shape app is built around <a href="https://pymatgen.org/">pymatgen's</a> wulffshape.py module's Plotly interface and allows users to input miller indices, surface energies, and lattice parameters to visualize 3D Wulff shapes. The surface phase diagram app allows users to input a .csv file containing surface energies as chemical potentials. A Tutorial tab will be added shortly to the site to provide further instructions on usage. The app is supported by Plotly Dash, pymatgen and the Materials Project API. Future updates will incorporate pre-trained checkpoints from the Open Catalyst Project to allow for on-demand design of catalysts and nanoparticles from ML inference.

Live now: 
- Interactive Wulff shape visualization
- Surface phase diagram generator (w/ chemical potentials and reaction conditions)
- Full dashboard for catalyst and nanoparticle design

ToDo:
- Reaction mechanism plotter.
- On-hand ML inference of surface thermodynamics using OCP checkpoints
- High-throughput screening framework builder
- Surface energy calculator
