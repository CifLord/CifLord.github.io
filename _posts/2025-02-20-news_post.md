The interactive Wulff shape construction app, "Lykoi" is now live! Check it out on the Lykoi tab above! Lykoi is built around <a href="https://pymatgen.org/">pymatgen's</a> wulffshape.py module's Plotly interface. The app is supported by Plotly Dash and allows users to input miller indices, surface energies, and lattice parameters to visualize 3D Wulff shapes.
