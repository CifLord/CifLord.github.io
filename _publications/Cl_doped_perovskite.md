excerpt: 'Triiodide/iodide (I3–/I–) redox couple-mediated solar cells, batteries, and electrochromic devices require highly efficient and stable electrocatalysts for I3– reduction reaction (IRR) to overcome performance limitations, whereas the widely used platinum (Pt) cathode for IRR has limitations of high price and unfavorable durability. In this work, we present a halogen element (chlorine) doping strategy to design low-cost perovskite-type electrocatalysts with enhanced IRR activity and stability. The dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) assembled by the LaFeO2.965−δCl0.035 cathode delivers an attractive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.4% with a remarkable PCE enhancement factor of 23% compared with Pt, which is higher than most of the reported non-Pt DSSC cathodes. Attractively, LaFeO2.965−δCl0.035 displays superior IRR activity/stability and structural stability in the I3–/I–-based electrolyte compared to pristine LaFeO3 because chlorine doping facilitates the creation of oxygen vacancies (active sites) and enhances surface acidity simultaneously. This study provides a new way for designing outstanding IRR electrocatalysts, which could be applied to many redox couple-mediated photo/electrochemical devices.'
