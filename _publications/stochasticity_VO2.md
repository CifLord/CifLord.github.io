excerpt: 'Vanadium dioxide (VO2), which exhibits a near-room-temperature insulator–metal transition, has great potential in applications of neuromorphic computing devices. Although its volatile switching property, which could emulate neuron spiking, has been studied widely, nanoscale studies of the structural stochasticity across the phase transition are still lacking. In this study, using in situ transmission electron microscopy and ex situ resistive switching measurement, we successfully characterized the structural phase transition between monoclinic and rutile VO2 at local areas in planar VO2/TiO2 device configuration under external biasing. After each resistive switching, different VO2 monoclinic crystal orientations are observed, forming different equilibrium states. We have evaluated a statistical cycle-to-cycle variation, demonstrated a stochastic nature of the volatile resistive switching, and presented an approach to study in-plane structural anisotropy. Our microscopic studies move a big step forward toward understanding the volatile switching mechanisms and the related applications of VO2 as the key material of neuromorphic computing.'
